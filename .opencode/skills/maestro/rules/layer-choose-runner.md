## Choose the runner by layer

Pick the thinnest runner the repo already uses that can observe the behavior. Mixing runners (Vitest rendering RN, Playwright for a class variant) wastes time and lies.

**Incorrect:** Vitest `render` of an Expo screen, or a Playwright spec whose only assertion is a button variant class.

**Correct:**

- **Schema / keys / API / hooks**: Vitest or Jest
- **Web UI**: Vitest or Jest plus `@testing-library/react`
- **Native presentation**: Jest (jest-expo if Expo) plus `@testing-library/react-native`
- **Multi-route web / desktop**: Playwright
- **Device / emulator**: Maestro
- **Authz / multi-user**: the repo's integration or DB suite

Notes: Discover scripts from `package.json` / `justfile`. Do not invent a workspace-wide `pnpm test`. If the repo has no harness, stop. Do not invent one.
